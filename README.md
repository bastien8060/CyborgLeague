# `CyborgLeague`
A League of Legends bot to play and win a 5v5 game in Summoners Rift!

> This is an ongoing work which isnt completely finished yet! (WIP alert)

This bot is able to play a game, and win in top/mid/bot using many factors in-game. 

This bot isn't made to carry a game however, although it possibly could in the near-future. This bot was made with the intention of making it play few minutes while the player is AFK, to avoid a temp-ban.
